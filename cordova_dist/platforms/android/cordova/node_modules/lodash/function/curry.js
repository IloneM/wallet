/**
 * Creates a function that accepts one or more arguments of `func` that when
 * called either invokes `func` returning its result, if all `func` arguments
 * have been provided, or returns a function that accepts one or more of the
 * remaining `func` arguments, and so on. The arity of `func` may be specified
 * if `func.length` is not sufficient.
 *
 * The `_.curry.placeholder` value, which defaults to `_` in monolithic builds,
 * may be used as a placeholder for provided arguments.
 *
 * **Note:** This method does not set the "length" property of curried functions.

 * @param {Function} func The function to curry.
 * @param {number} [arity=func.length] The arity of `func`.
 * @param- {Object} [guard] Enables use as a callback for functions like `_.map`.
 * @returns {Function} Returns the new curried function.
 * @example
 *
 * var abc = function(a, b, c) {
 *   return [a, b, c];
 * };
