 * their own, not inherited, enumerable properties.

 * @param {Array|string} path The path of the property to get.
 * @param {*} srcValue The value to match.
 * @returns {Function} Returns the new function.
 * @example
 *
 * var users = [

 * ];
 *
 * _.find(users, _.matchesProperty('user', 'fred'));
