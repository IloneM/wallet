/**
 * Creates a function that performs a deep comparison between a given object
 * and `source`, returning `true` if the given object has equivalent property
 * values, else `false`.
 *
 * **Note:** This method supports comparing arrays, booleans, `Date` objects,
 * numbers, `Object` objects, regexes, and strings. Objects are compared by
 * their own, not inherited, enumerable properties. For comparing a single
 * own or inherited property value see `_.matchesProperty`.
 *
 * @static
 * @memberOf _
 * @category Utility
 * @param {Object} source The object of property values to match.
 * @returns {Function} Returns the new function.
 * @example
 *
 * var users = [
 *   { 'user': 'barney', 'age': 36, 'active': true },
 *   { 'user': 'fred',   'age': 40, 'active': false }
 * ];
 *
 * _.filter(users, _.matches({ 'age': 40, 'active': false }));
 * // => [{ 'user': 'fred', 'age': 40, 'active': false }]
