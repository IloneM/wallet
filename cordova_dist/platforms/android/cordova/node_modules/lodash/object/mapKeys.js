/**
 * The opposite of `_.mapValues`; this method creates an object with the
 * same values as `object` and keys generated by running each own enumerable
 * property of `object` through `iteratee`.
 *
 * @static
 * @memberOf _
 * @category Object
 * @param {Object} object The object to iterate over.
 * @param {Function|Object|string} [iteratee=_.identity] The function invoked
 *  per iteration.
 * @param {*} [thisArg] The `this` binding of `iteratee`.
 * @returns {Object} Returns the new mapped object.
 * @example
 *
 * _.mapKeys({ 'a': 1, 'b': 2 }, function(value, key) {
 *   return key + value;
 * });
 * // => { 'a1': 1, 'b2': 2 }
