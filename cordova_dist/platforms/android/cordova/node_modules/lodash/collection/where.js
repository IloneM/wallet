/**
 * Performs a deep comparison between each element in `collection` and the
 * source object, returning an array of all elements that have equivalent
 * property values.
 *
 * **Note:** This method supports comparing arrays, booleans, `Date` objects,
 * numbers, `Object` objects, regexes, and strings. Objects are compared by
 * their own, not inherited, enumerable properties. For comparing a single
 * own or inherited property value see `_.matchesProperty`.
 *
 * @static
 * @memberOf _
 * @category Collection
 * @param {Array|Object|string} collection The collection to search.
 * @param {Object} source The object of property values to match.
 * @returns {Array} Returns the new filtered array.
 * @example
 *
 * var users = [
 *   { 'user': 'barney', 'age': 36, 'active': false, 'pets': ['hoppy'] },
 *   { 'user': 'fred',   'age': 40, 'active': true, 'pets': ['baby puss', 'dino'] }
 * ];
 *
 * _.pluck(_.where(users, { 'age': 36, 'active': false }), 'user');
 * // => ['barney']
 *
 * _.pluck(_.where(users, { 'pets': ['dino'] }), 'user');
