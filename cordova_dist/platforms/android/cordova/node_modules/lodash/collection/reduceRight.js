 * This method is like `_.reduce` except that it iterates over elements of

 * @static
 * @memberOf _
 * @alias foldr
 * @category Collection
 * @param {Array|Object|string} collection The collection to iterate over.
 * @param {Function} [iteratee=_.identity] The function invoked per iteration.
 * @param {*} [accumulator] The initial value.
 * @param {*} [thisArg] The `this` binding of `iteratee`.
 * @returns {*} Returns the accumulated value.
 * @example
 *
 * var array = [[0, 1], [2, 3], [4, 5]];
 *
 * _.reduceRight(array, function(flattened, other) {
 *   return flattened.concat(other);
 * }, []);
 * // => [4, 5, 2, 3, 0, 1]
