 * Converts the characters "&", "<", ">", '"', "'", and "\`", in `string` to

 * **Note:** No other characters are escaped. To escape additional characters
 * use a third-party library like [_he_](https://mths.be/he).
 *
 * Though the ">" character is escaped for symmetry, characters like
 * ">" and "/" don't need escaping in HTML and have no special meaning
 * unless they're part of a tag or unquoted attribute value.
 * See [Mathias Bynens's article](https://mathiasbynens.be/notes/ambiguous-ampersands)
 * (under "semi-related fun fact") for more details.
 *
 * Backticks are escaped because in Internet Explorer < 9, they can break out
 * of attribute values or HTML comments. See [#59](https://html5sec.org/#59),
 * [#102](https://html5sec.org/#102), [#108](https://html5sec.org/#108), and
 * [#133](https://html5sec.org/#133) of the [HTML5 Security Cheatsheet](https://html5sec.org/)
 * for more details.
 *
 * When working with HTML you should always [quote attribute values](http://wonko.com/post/html-escaping)
 * to reduce XSS vectors.
